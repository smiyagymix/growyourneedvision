# Copilot System Instructions — Production Strict Mode

## Unused Declarations Policy (MANDATORY)

If any component, class, function, hook, variable, or module is declared and triggers warnings such as:
- "is declared but its value is never read"
- "defined but never used"

### DO NOT delete it by default.

### Required behavior:
1. Assume the declaration is intentional and architecturally required.
2. Prefer real functional integration over removal.
3. Resolve warnings by actual usage, not suppression.
4. Do NOT disable ESLint or TypeScript rules.
5. Do NOT add fake or dummy references.
6. Only delete if the user explicitly requests deletion.

### Integration rules:
- Components must be mounted in real render paths.
- Error boundaries must wrap real children.
- Hooks must be executed with real side effects.
- Utilities must be called with real inputs/outputs.
- Code must be reachable at runtime.

### Production standard:
- Strict TypeScript
- Strict ESLint
- End-to-end execution
- No dead code
